    "To revolutionize Rwanda's agricultural marketplace by connecting farmers directly with buyers, ensuring fair prices and fresh produce for all.",

  // ADDED 'story' property
  story:
    "AgriConnect Rwanda was founded with a clear vision: to empower Rwandan farmers and provide consumers with direct access to fresh, high-quality produce. We recognized the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in reaching wider markets and the lack of transparency in the supply chain. Our platform leverages technology to bridge this gap, creating a seamless and efficient marketplace. From humble beginnings, we've grown into a vital link in Rwanda's agricultural sector, fostering sustainable growth and economic empowerment for our farming communities.",
